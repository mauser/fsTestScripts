The script "fsBasics.py" can be used to check the basic functions of a file system.
It was developed to detect regressions during the development of a metadata server.
The script does not handle any data related functions. 
It checks the following features:
	- Creation of files / directories
	- Deletion files / directories
	- Moving of files
	- Attribute changes

The script can be measure the performance of the aforementioned operations,
this is especially useful if one wants to analyse the behaviour of file systems
with directories that include a large number of files.

See 'fsBasics.py -h' for the possible options.
